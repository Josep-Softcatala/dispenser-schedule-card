## Compatibility

This card was created for the Xiaomi Smart Pet Feeder running 
[esphome-miot](https://github.com/dhewg/esphome-miot),
but support for other types of dispensers may be added if enough is known
about the structure. Please open an issue including as much detail as possible.

`entity` state currently must be contain a string with the the structure
`[int id],[int hour],[int minute],[int amount],[int status]`, as a 
comma-separated list, where `id` is the entry index, `hour` is the 23h formatted
hour at which to dispense, `minute` is the minute of the hour at which to dispense, `amount`
is the amount to dispense (portions, grams, etc) and `status` is an 
integer with the following meaning:
 -   0 - dispensed successfully for today
 -   1 - dispense failed for today (lack of food, food stuck, etc)
 - 254 - currently dispensing
 - 255 - pending for today

Example:

`0,10,30,5,0,1,12,0,10,255`

- entry 0: 10:30 dispense 5 portions, dispensed successfully.
- entry 1: 12:00 dispense 10 portions, pending.

`skipped` is assumed when the entry is still `pending` but the current time is
greater than the dispense time.

A customizable option using Jinja2 templates to extract the schedule from
arbitrary entities is also under consideration.
